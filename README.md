# Hello! Welcome to my SOC 23' Project Street Fighter II - Reinforcement Learning.

This repository contains the material and assignments of the project through the 7 weeks.

## Duration: 7 Weeks
## Time Commitment per week: 2-2.5 hours per day

## Skills picked up:
- 

## Logistics
1. Each week, material will be uploaded in a folder named with the week number. Weekly, you are required to do four things: 
    * View the theory resources, ask questions.
    * View the coding task (based on the week's theory) and ask lots of questions. Setup info will be given for libraries/software. Code away to glory!
    * Solve the theory assignment. You might find some of the problems difficult. From a practical point of view, the theory assignment will cover problems which you will face before writing code, like modeling. This is extremely important, because as you will soon discover, more than 80% of machine learning is just humans learning more about their own cognitive capabilites!
    * Watch the tutorial video. If the coding or theory assignment has challenging elements, I will solve a similar problem and upload it as a tutorial video.
2. Two media of communication: This Github Repo and the aforementioned Google Classroom link.
3. On weekends, there will be an online review meet. The agenda of every meet will always include doubts, and reviewing what you have learnt in the week.
4. The deadlines for the tasks will generally be a week from the date of announcement. I will also specify the deadline along with the problem statement.
5. The main project work on Street Fighter II ROM will take two full weeks, towards the end of the 8-week paradigm when you all will be enjoying your vacations :)

## Important!
This is not a course. If you look at the assignment question and you can't figure out the answer, you can ask me (yes, you can ask back the exact same question!). I'll give you the exact answer to that question. The only thing I'll need to know beforehand is that you gave it a try and so, I will ask how you decided to attack the problem. So these are not technically "assignments", they are just "topic reviews".


## What counts as a valid submission?
- Code
You are free to borrow the code from stackoverflow/GPT/copilot. It would be a criminal waste of the internet and AI to not make use of the plethora of resources available. But what you must do is cite whatever you used to code. As long as you modified the code you borrowed to some significant extent and as long as you acknowledge the original writers, it counts as your work. Insufficient attribution is essentially plagiarsim.
- Descriptions
For every code file you write, I demand a short description (< 200 words) of what you think it does and what changes you made to the code you borrowed if any. This description has to be 100% your work, no GPT/AI allowed.

## Have fun learning!!
