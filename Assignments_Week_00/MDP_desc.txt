A Car has one of three states at a time -- Cool, Warm, Overheat

Cool:
    Car can go Fast or Slow
        Fast -- reward(2) distance(2) next-state(0.5 probability each for Cool or Warm)
        Slow -- reward(1) distance(1) next-state(Cool)

Warm:
    Car can go Fast or Slow
        Fast -- reward(-10) distance(0) next-state(Overheat)
        Slow -- reward(1) distance(0.5) next-state(0.5 probability each for Cool or Warm)

Overheat:
    Car can go no further

Take a string of actions (Fast or Slow) from the user and output the final distance covered and reward
